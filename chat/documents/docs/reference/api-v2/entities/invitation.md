# Invitation

Users can enter data into the system using an invitation. An invitation is roughly a template that indicates required and valid values that will be saved to the database. The invitation contains a list of fields that need to be completed by the user.

The subsections contain information on the types of Invitations, their structure, the fields it can have, and how to define them with different specifiers.
