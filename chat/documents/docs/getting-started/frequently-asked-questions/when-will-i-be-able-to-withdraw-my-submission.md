# When will I be able to withdraw my submission?

#### For Authors

The timeline for submission withdrawals is determined by the Program Chairs of each venue. Therefore, there is not a single overarching OpenReview withdrawal policy. If you have questions about when in a venue workflow you will be able to withdraw your submission, you should reach out to the Program Chairs of that venue directly.&#x20;

#### For Program Chairs&#x20;

Authors are able to withdraw their paper at any time after the submission deadline or after [Post Submission Stage](../../reference/stages/post-submission-stage.md) has been run. You can optionally restrict the withdrawal window from your [venue request form](../hosting-a-venue-on-openreview/navigating-your-venue-pages.md). You can also use the venue request form to configure the visibility of withdrawn and desk-rejected papers, as well as the identities of their authors.
