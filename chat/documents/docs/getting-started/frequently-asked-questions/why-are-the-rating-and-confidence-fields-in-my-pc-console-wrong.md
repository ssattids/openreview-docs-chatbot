# Why are the "rating" and "confidence" fields in my PC Console wrong?

If you removed the rating or confidence fields from your Official Review form, the PC console will show an average rating and/or confidence of 0 for each paper. If you replaced them with custom values, you can customize your PC console to show the average of those values instead.

1. From your venue request form, click [Review Stage](../../reference/stages/review-stage.md).&#x20;
2. Select which field you want to be used in place of rating and/or confidence. It must be in the "Additional Review Form Options" field. The options reviewers can select for that field must follow the format "number: description", for example "1: Very Poor".&#x20;
3. Enter the field name for the "Review Rating Field Name" (or "Review Confidence Field Name"). It must match the case as it is entered in Additional Review Form Options.&#x20;
4. Click "Submit".&#x20;
