# Add or remove a name from your profile

Users can keep multiple names in their profiles and select one as preferred, which will be used for author submission and identity display. Names can be replaced by new names in the profile and in some submissions as long as the organizers of the venue allow it.

#### Adding a name to your profile and mark it as preferred

1. Go to your profile page at https://openreview.net/profile
2. Click 'Edit Profile'.
3. Locate the 'Names' section and click the blue plus sign underneath your name.&#x20;
4. Enter your name and then click ‘Save Profile Changes’ at the bottom of the page.

If you would like to make that name preferred, you can do so by clicking ‘Edit profile’ once more and selecting ‘Make Preferred’ next to your desired name. The option to make a name preferred will not appear until you have saved the new name to your profile.

Submissions can be updated with the user's preferred name if the organizers of the venue that the user submitted to allow it.

#### Removing a name from your profile

1. Go to your profile page at https://openreview.net/profile

4. Click on the button 'Request Deletion' next to the name you want to remove.
