# How to modify the Review, Meta Review, and Decision Forms

The review, meta review, and decision forms should be modified only through the [venue request form](../../getting-started/hosting-a-venue-on-openreview/navigating-your-venue-pages.md#venue-request-form). Do not edit the review, meta review, or decision invitations directly from the invitation editor, or your changes will be overwritten.&#x20;

Example: In order to edit the review form, run the [Review Stage](../../reference/stages/review-stage.md) from the venue request form. Any additional fields can be added in valid JSON to the ‘Additional Review Form Options’ field, and any fields can be removed using the ‘Remove Review Form Options’ field. A similar process can be followed for meta-reviews and decisions using the Meta Review and Decision stages.
