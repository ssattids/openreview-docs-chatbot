# How to Make Submissions Available Before the Submission Deadline

On the request form for your venue, click on the ‘Post Submission’ button to make submissions available according to the settings selected in the fields ‘Author and Reviewer Anonymity’ and ‘Submission Readers’ of the venue request. This means that:

* You can choose which fields are kept hidden (author names are automatically hidden if the venue is double blind).
* If you select the option ‘Everyone (submissions are public)’ in ‘Submission Readers’, then all submissions will be public.
* If submissions should be private, then they can be released to the assigned program committee (only assigned reviewers, for example), to the entire program committee (all reviewers), or to PCs and authors only. However , assignments can't be made until after the submission deadline passes.
