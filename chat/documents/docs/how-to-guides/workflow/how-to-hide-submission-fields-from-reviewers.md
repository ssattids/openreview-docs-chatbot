# How to Hide Submission Fields from Reviewers

You can hide certain fields of the submission form from Reviewers using the [Post Submission Stage](../../reference/stages/post-submission-stage.md). From the venue request form, click 'Post Submission Stage'. In the 'Hide Fields' section, enter a comma-separated list of fields that you want hidden from Reviewers. Author identities are hidden by default. Double blind venues will need to wait to do this until their submission deadline has passed; single blind venues can do this at any time.&#x20;
