# How to have different tracks or types of submissions for a single venue

It is not possible to support multiple different workflows for different types of papers within a single venue. If, however, you want to accept distinct types of submissions that will all follow the same workflow, you can [add a ‘track’ field to your submission form](../../getting-started/hosting-a-venue-on-openreview/customizing-your-submission-form.md). If you reach out to OpenReview support at info@openreview.net, we can then customize your PC console to allow you to filter and sort by track.
