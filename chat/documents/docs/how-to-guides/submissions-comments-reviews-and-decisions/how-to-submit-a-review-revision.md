# How to submit a Review Revision

The Review Revision Stage is run when PCs want to add new fields to a review for reviewers to fill out usually after the rebuttal period. These new fields are often the final rating of the paper and the justification for changing the rating. This stage cannot be run from the venue request page and must be requested.

When Review Revisions are active, reviewers will be able to edit their posted reviews. Reviewers will be able to submit multiple Review Revisions, with the last one being the final one shown in the Official Review.&#x20;

To post a review revision:

1. Click on the "Edit" button, found next to the title of the review note.&#x20;
2. Click on "Review Revision". This will open the note editor, where you will be able to edit the review. Note you will only be able to edit the fields that the PCs allow to be edited (so you might not be able to edit all the original fields of your review)
