# How to add formatting to reviews or comments

Venues can choose to allow users to add basic formatting to text content by enabling Markdown in specific places such as official reviews and rebuttals. Markdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents based on common conventions for indicating formatting. It is currently used by many prominent websites including GitHub and StackOverflow. It can be used to add headings, bold, italics, lists, tables, and more. For a brief overview of the features of Markdown see [CommonMark.orgâ€™s reference](https://commonmark.org/help/). OpenReview follows the [CommonMark spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/), with the exception of images and inline HTML which are not supported.

If Markdown is enabled, you will see that the text input has two tabs at the top: Write and Preview. This feature allows you to enter plain text in the Write tab and quickly see what the HTML output will look on the page in the Preview tab.

If Markdown formatting has not been enabled by the venue, you can still format your text using regular line breaks and spaces for indentation.
