# How to deploy the proposed assignments

From the assignment page, click ‘Deploy assignments’ next to the matching configuration of your choice. Note that this will not notify group members of their assignments. You can contact different roles either [through their group consoles](../../communication/how-to-send-messages-through-the-ui.md) or [through the python client](../../communication/how-to-send-messages-with-the-python-client.md).
