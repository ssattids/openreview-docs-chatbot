# How to view messages sent through OpenReview

1. Go to https://openreview.net/messages. You should see any messages sent from your venue.
2. Filter messages by Parent Group to narrow your search:&#x20;
   * If you sent a message through a group console, enter that group ID.&#x20;
   * If you sent a message through the python client and specified the parent group, search by that parent group.&#x20;
   * If you sent a message through the PC console, there will not be a parent group.
3. You can also filter by recipient, email status, and subject. &#x20;
