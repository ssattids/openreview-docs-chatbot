# Navigating your Venue Pages

After your venue is deployed, you will have access to multiple pages in OpenReview:

#### Program Chair Console&#x20;

You can find a link to your PC console under ‘Active Venues’ on the OpenReview homepage.

#### Venue Request Form&#x20;

The venue request form contains the settings that were selected in your venue’s support request form. You can get to the venue request form using the ‘Full venue configuration’ link at the bottom of your PC console. Almost all customizations, such as review form modifications, deadline changes, and workflow stages, should be made through the venue request form.

#### Committee Member Consoles&#x20;

Each type of committee member (Reviewers, Area Chairs, and Senior Area Chairs) for your venue will have their own console. You can access these consoles through each of the links under ‘Venue Roles’ at the bottom of your PC console.&#x20;
