# Changing your submission deadline

If you want to change your submission deadline, you can do so using the [Revision](../../reference/stages/revision.md) button on the [venue request form](navigating-your-venue-pages.md#venue-request-form). Note that you can only have one submission deadline for all submissions, and it is not possible to have different deadlines for different types of papers, or to extend the deadline only for a subset of authors.&#x20;

**If you used an abstract registration deadline** and want to change the submission deadline after the abstract deadline has passed, you will need to rerun the Post Submission stage after changing the Submission Deadline.&#x20;
