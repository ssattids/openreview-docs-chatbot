# How do I complete my tasks?

Throughout the course of a conference/workshop, members of the committee groups are assigned tasks to complete, such as, Expertise Selection, Reviewing, and the Reviewer License Agreement. Users can find their tasks by clicking on the Tasks button (openreview.net/tasks) on the red nav bar at the top of the page. They can also find these tasks in their respective venue consoles.

They'll see a list of different venue IDs and the number of pending and completed tasks.

To view the tasks, click on the arrow next to the venue ID or "Show pending tasks and completed tasks". Clicking on a task link will redirect the user to another page to complete the task. When the task is completed it will be grayed out on the Tasks page. When the expiration date for that task expires the task will disappear from the Tasks page.
