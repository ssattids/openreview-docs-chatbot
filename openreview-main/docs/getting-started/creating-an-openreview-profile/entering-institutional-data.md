# Entering Institutional Data

To add institutional data to your OpenReview profile, go to your profile page at https://openreview.net/profile and click 'Edit profile'. You must enter at least one position under 'Education & Career History' for your profile to be saved. You can choose one position from the dropdown, which includes the most commonly used ones. If none of the positions in the dropdown reflect the position you are entering, you can type your own.&#x20;

Next, enter a valid institution name (e.g. University of Massachusetts, Amherst) and domain (e.g. umass.edu) from the dropdown or type it in if not present. You can leave the 'End' field empty if you are currently in that position, or you can enter when you are expected to leave that position.
