# Finding your profile ID

Your OpenReview profile ID is a unique string made up of a tilde concatenated with your full name and a number, for example ∼First\_Last1. If you go to your OpenReview profile, your ID will be at the end of the url (for example, https://openreview.net/profile?id=<mark style="background-color:purple;">∼Your\_Id1</mark>)
