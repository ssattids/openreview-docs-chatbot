# How to edit a submission after the deadline - Authors

If revisions have been enabled by your venue's Program Chairs, you may edit your submission by clicking the Revision button on its forum page. You can find your submission by going to the Author console listed in the venue's home page or by going to your profile under the section 'Recent Publications'.
