# Revision

The Revision button on the venue request form allows you to modify selections made in the support request form. There are also new fields, 'Additional Submission', 'Hide Fields', 'Remove Submission Options', which allow PCs to modify the submission form.&#x20;

Use of the Revision button will overwrite any changes to the Submission invitation that were made through the invitation editor rather than through the venue request form.
