# Comment Stage

#### What it Does&#x20;

The Comment Stage creates [Comment Invitations](../default-forms/default-comment-form.md) for all submissions with custom participants. The Comment forms have a dropdown menu where users can select the intended readers of their comments.&#x20;

#### When to Use it

Double blind venues can only run the Comment Stage after the submission deadline has passed. Single-blind venues can run the Comment Stage before the submission deadline if they first run Post Submission Stage.&#x20;
