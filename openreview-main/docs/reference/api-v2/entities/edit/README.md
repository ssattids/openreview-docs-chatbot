# Edit

Edits are used to create Invitations, Groups and Notes. Therefore, there are three kinds of Edits: Invitation Edits, Group Edits and Note Edits. Once an Edit is created, it goes through the process of inference to create the corresponding entity. Consequently, Edits contain the history of changes of the entity that they create. Adding, removing or modifying an existing Edit will change the resulting entity.
